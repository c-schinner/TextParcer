# TextParcer
This Text Parcer was my first coding project, a lot of basics and repition of code were used to finish this.

Used user input to get starting text, as well as getting certian letters to check number of repititions in code.
Used a few python methods and functions to count how many words were in the text, as well as reversing the text and printing out the result.

Used a dictionary to find out if a certain word appeared inside the text and printed out the result.
