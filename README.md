# TextParcer
Text Parser Program
The Text Parser Program is a simple Python script that takes an article as input and performs various operations on it, including counting the occurrences of specified letters, calculating the number of words, extracting the first and last letters, displaying the inverted text, and checking for the presence of a specific word. The program is designed to provide insights into the content of the input article.

# Usage
Run the program by executing the following command in your terminal:

python text_parser.py


The program will prompt you to insert an article. Enter the article text and press Enter.

The program will then prompt you to provide three letters: L1, L2, and L3.

The program will process the input and display the results as follows:

It will show how many times each of the provided letters (L1, L2, and L3) appears in the article.
It will display the total number of words in the article.
It will reveal the first letter of the article.
It will reveal the last letter of the article.
It will display the inverted text, i.e., the words in reverse order.
It will inform you whether the word 'python' was found in the text or not.


Insert an article please: This is a sample article for demonstration purposes.
Give me the first letter: s
Give me the second letter: p
Give me the third letter: r

How much your letters appear in the article:
L1 5 times
L2 2 times
L3 3 times

There are 8 words in your article.

The first letter in the article is:
t

The last letter in the article is:
.

This is the inverted text:
If we order the text in reverse 'purposes. demonstration for article sample a is This'

The word 'python' was not found in the text.


# Note
Keep in mind that this program is a basic text parser and may not handle all possible edge cases. It's intended for educational purposes and can be extended to include more advanced text analysis features.
